# 📚 Reading Group @ iNLP Lab

Welcome to the **[inclusive NLP (iNLP) Lab](https://isakzhang.github.io/group.html)** at SUTD!  

This page contains the schedule of our weekly reading group - where we share and discuss the latest research in natural language processing and large language models.

👉 If you'd like to join us or give a talk (to make this reading group more inclusive :), please feel free to reach out.

## 🌟 About iNLP Lab

The **[inclusive NLP (iNLP) Lab](https://isakzhang.github.io/group.html)** at SUTD is dedicated to advancing the next generation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that are not only powerful, but also inclusive and trustworthy.

- Inclusive → We design models that support diverse languages, cultures, and users. This includes research on multilingual LLMs, accessibility through efficient and compressed models, and human-centered design for broader adoption.
- Trustworthy → We ensure that NLP systems are safe, robust, and reliable across settings. Our work includes LLM safety frameworks, fair and comprehensive evaluation, and mechanistic studies to better understand knowledge and reasoning inside LLMs.
- Fundamentals → Beyond application-driven projects, we pursue fundamental questions in machine learning and language modeling, exploring how models represent, reason, and interact with humans.
